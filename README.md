# Sorting Algorithms Visualiser

![Sorting Algorithms Visualiser Demo](Assets/WindowIcon.png)

## Overview

The Sorting Algorithms Visualiser is a Python project that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. It utilizes the pygame library to create an interactive interface for sorting visualizations.

## Features

- Currently supports the following sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Cocktail Sort
  - Shell Sort
- Sort data in both ascending and descending order.
- Intuitive user interface for easy navigation.
- Real-time visualization of the sorting process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the Sorting Algorithms Visualiser, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (You can install it using `pip install pygame` in your preferred terminal)


### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vignesh-Devendiran/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualiser.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sorting-algorithms-visualiser
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python SortingAlgorithmsVisualiser.py
   ```

## Usage

- Launch the application by running `SortingAlgorithmsVisualiser.py`.
- Select a sorting algorithm from the available options.
- Choose whether you want to sort the data in ascending or descending order.
- Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.
- Observe the sorting process in real-time.
- You can reset the visualization or choose a different algorithm at any time.

## Roadmap

The project is actively being developed, and future enhancements may include:

- Implementation of audio feedback to enhance the user experience.
- Additional sorting algorithms.
- Customization options for data size and speed of visualization.
